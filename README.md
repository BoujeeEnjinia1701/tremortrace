## Problem

Tremor severity is scored during short clinic visits, which misses how it varies day to day.

## Concept

Wrist-worn IMU band that logs tremor frequency and amplitude continuously, with an open analysis notebook that produces a daily tremor profile.

Full design precis: [docs/02-concept.md](docs/02-concept.md)

## Key components

- 6-axis IMU
- nRF52 BLE module
- LiPo cell
- Printed enclosure
- Silicone strap

The working bill of materials is in [bom/bom.csv](bom/bom.csv).

## Safety

> This is a research and educational prototype. It is not a medical device, has not been cleared or approved by any regulator, and must not be used to diagnose, treat or monitor any person.

## Documentation

Controlled documents follow the portfolio [documentation standard](.kit/STANDARDS.md). Each carries a document ID (TRT-PRC-001 for the precis), a version and a revision history. Branded PDFs are built with `python .kit/render.py` and attached to GitHub Releases when a document is tagged, for example `TRT-PRC-001/v1.0`.
